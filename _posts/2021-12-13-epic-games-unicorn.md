If you canâ€™t see the members of a specific organization, Just like this:

![unicorn](/assets/img/20211213/unicorn.png)

Because true people number is:

![tnum](/assets/img/20211213/tnum.png)

then what we can see max number is:

![fnum](/assets/img/20211213/fnum.png)

The problem is that GitHub can't show such a large list of member, **but** only other people in the organization can see the organization logo on the homepage of the people in the same organization.

So, you can replace ```{{}}``` with your information and run this command and make your account visibility becomes **PUBLIC**.

```
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
-H "Authorization: token {{your personal access tokens(E.g. ghp_xxx...xxx)}}" \
-H "Content-Length: 0" \
-X PUT \
https://api.github.com/orgs/EpicGames/public_members/{{your username of GitHub}}
```
